A Surreal shooter with Psychadelic visuals developed in the Source engine. My first C++ project to help me understand the language better!

HD is a surreal, fast paced multiplayer movement shooter based on games like Cruelty Squad and LSD Dream Emulator, but with fast paced movement and purely skill based gameplay along the lines of Quake 3 Arena.

I hope to show something for the game by the end of 2023

There will be no microtransactions or loot boxes, and the textures and models are pitched by a group of deranged people like me.
